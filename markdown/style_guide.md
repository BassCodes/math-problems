## Entering Sources

In abstract, a source is a published document that contains a list of math problems.
These sources can be in the form of Printed pages, PDF files, forum posts, blog posts, or anything similar.
The source should have a publicly accessible URL for reference.
If the source is unavailable online, send a copy to the administrator to be uploaded to the site.

Note see [Copyright](./copyright) for some legal details.

### Unsuitable Sources

Unless officially published, classwork (tests, labs, etc.) is not suitable.
These problems weren't meant to be distributed and most-of-the-time aren't very interesting.

Assorted individual problems are not suitable.
Perhaps in the future these could be added to the site, but it's really not set up for them at the moment.

This site should not be used as a means to publish problems.
If you have created an interesting set of problems and want add them to this site, please publish them elsewhere first.

## Problem Format

Each problem page has three major sections

- Problem statement
- Solutions
- Answer

## Adapting Problems

### Multiple Choices

When adapting a problem from a source, remove any multiple choice answers.
If solving the problem requires the choices, then rewrite the problem to be solvable without them.
If the problem cannot be reasonably solved without the choices, then omit the problem.

It's perfectly fine to omit problems. Don't contort the problem too far just to make it solvable.

### Problem Statement

Problem statements provide a distinct goal in the form of a request or a question. For example

<div class="example">
How many natural numbers less than $100$ are divisible by $8$?
</div>

Or

<div class="example">
Compute integral
$$
\int_{0}^{10} x^2 \,dx
$$
</div>

If a question has multiple answers, or a set of answers, indicate so in the statement. For example

<div class="example">
Find all values of $x$ where $x^2 = 1$
</div>

### Brevity

Problem statements should be short and concise.
Adapt long statements to be shorter. For example, this problem statement is too long

<div class="example bad">
A function $f(x)$ is defined as

$$
f(x) = \frac{\lvert x\rvert}{x}-5e^x+6
$$

Compute the limit of $f(x)$ as it approaches zero.

$$
\lim_{x\to0} \left(\frac{\lvert x\rvert}{x}-5e^x+6  \right)
$$

</div>

It should be shortened to

<div class="example good">
Compute limit

$$
\lim_{x\to0} \left(\frac{\lvert x\rvert}{x}-5e^x+6  \right)
$$

</div>

## Writing Solutions

Solutions should be approachable to the problem's intended audience.
If the problem is from a college calculus competition,
then its primary solution should be approachable to students of college level calculus.

Additional solutions can be added with more advanced methods if they are interesting.

### Solution format

Each line of a solution should either be a mathematical expression or a imperative statement. For example

## Final Note

This document is subject to change.

Are there any improvements you have to suggest for the style guide?
Please let me know.
There's a good chance you know a thing or two that I don't so don't hesitate if you have a suggestion.
